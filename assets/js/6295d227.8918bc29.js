The procedural programming comes into the picture because a kernel is trying to solve a specific PDE by using a specific method. In this sense, the kernel's design is driven keeping procedure programming in mind. However, a kernel can solve several problems governed by the same PDE. These problems can have different types of boundary conditions and material properties. Also, we can use several numerical methods to solve the problem. In order to facilitate these objectives, we use object oriented programming."})})]})}function h(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,s.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,a.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,a.jsx)(p,{...e})}):p(e)}},54213:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{R:()=>r,x:()=>o});var i=n(36672);const a={},s=i.createContext(a);function r(e){const t=i.useContext(s);return i.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function o(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(a):e.components||a:r(e.components),i.createElement(s.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}},66895:e=>{e.exports=JSON.parse('{"permalink":"/blog/how-to-setup-a-new-kernel-in-easifem","source":"@site/docs/blog/how-to-setup-a-new-kernel-in-easifem.md","title":"Setting up a new kernel using EASIFEM","description":"This post provides definition of Kernel in EASIFEM and provides a step by step guide to create a new kernel.","date":"2025-05-11T09:05:24.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"kernel","permalink":"/blog/tags/kernel"},{"inline":true,"label":"guide","permalink":"/blog/tags/guide"},{"inline":true,"label":"tutorial","permalink":"/blog/tags/tutorial"}],"readingTime":9.785,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Vikas Sharma","title":"Assistant Professor, Kyoto University, Japan","url":"https://github.com/vickysharma0812","socials":{"x":"https://x.com/vickysharma0812","github":"https://github.com/vickysharma0812"},"imageURL":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/easifem/authors/refs/heads/main/images/vickysharma0812.jpg","key":"vickysharma0812","page":null},{"name":"Shion Shimizu","title":"Doctoral Student, Kyoto University, Japan","url":"https://github.com/shishiousan","socials":{"github":"https://github.com/shishiousan"},"imageURL":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/easifem/authors/refs/heads/main/images/shishiousan.jpg","key":"shishiousan","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Setting up a new kernel using EASIFEM","description":"This post provides definition of Kernel in EASIFEM and provides a step by step guide to create a new kernel.","authors":["vickysharma0812","shishiousan"],"tags":["kernel","guide","tutorial"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"unlisted":false}')}}]);
