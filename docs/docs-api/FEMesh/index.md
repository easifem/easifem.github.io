# FEMesh

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD041 MD013 MD033 MD012 -->

`FEMesh_` datatype handles the finite element mesh. It is a child class of  [AbstractMesh_](/docs/docs-api/AbstractMesh/AbstractMesh_.md) and inherits all its methods. It is used to store the mesh data and provide methods for mesh manipulation, such as adding nodes, elements, and boundaries.

import EXAMPLE26 from "./FEMesh_.md";

## All methods

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
