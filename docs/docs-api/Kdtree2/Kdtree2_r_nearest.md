# Kdtree2_r_nearest

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->

Find the nearest neighbors to point '`idxin`', within SQUARED
Euclidean distance '`r2`'. Upon ENTRY, `nalloc` must be the
size of memory allocated for `results(1:nalloc)`. Upon
EXIT, `nfound` is the number actually found within the ball.

Note that if `nfound .gt. nalloc` then more neighbors were found
than there were storage to store. The resulting list is NOT
the smallest ball inside norm $r^2$

Results are NOT sorted unless tree was created with sort option.
