# AbstractKernel

`AbstractKernel_` class is an abstract class for designing kernels. You can see the structure of the `AbstractKernel` [here](./AbstractKernel_.md).

## Constructor Methods

### SetAbstractKernelParam

This method sets the essential parameters of the kernel. The user should use this method to set the parameters in the kernel. You can find more information here [SetAbstractKernelParam](./SetAbstractKernelParam.md).

### CheckEssentialParam

It check the essential parameters of the kernel. This method is called internally to check the validity of the data while initiating the kernel. A general user should not worry about it. You can find more information [here](./CheckEssentialParam.md).

### Initiate

This method reads the parameters and store them in the abstract kernel. This method is usually extended by the child classes. You can find more information here [Initiate](./Initiate.md)

### Deallocate

This method deallocates the memory of the kernel. This method is usually extended by the child classes. You can find more information here [Deallocate](./Deallocate.md)

### PreCheckError

This method is called to check the errors in the kernel. This method is called before setting the kernel. This is also an internal method and a general user  should not worry about it. You can find more information here [PreCheckError](./PreCheckError.md).

### PostCheckError

This method is called to check the errors in the kernel. This method is called after setting the kernel. This is also an internal method and a general user  should not worry about it. This method is documented [here](./PostCheckError.md).

### CheckError

This method checks the errors in the Kernel. This method is called internally to check the validity of the data while initiating the kernel. A general user should not worry about it. You can find more information [here](./CheckError.md).

## Initiating fields

### KernelInitiateSpaceMatrix

This subroutine is defined in `KernelMatrixField_Method`. You can find about this subroutine [here](./KernelInitiateSpaceMatrix.md)

### KernelInitiateTangentMatrix

This subroutine is defined in `KernelMatrixField_Method`. You can find about this subroutine [here](./KernelInitiateTangentMatrix.md)

### InitiateFields

### InitiateTangentMatrix

This subroutine initiate the tangent matrix of the kernel.

### InitiateScalarFields

### InitiateSTScalarFields

### InitiateVectorFields

### InitiateSTVectorFields

### InitiateMatrixFields
