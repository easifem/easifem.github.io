# dgssvx

DGSSVX solves the system of linear equations $A\cdot X = B$ or $A^T\cdot X = B$

It uses the LU factorization from `dgstrf`. Error bounds on the solution and a condition estimate are also provided. More details are give below.

## A is NCformat

If A is stored column-wise (`A->Stype = SLU_NC`):

1. If `options->Equil = YES`, scaling factors are computed to equilibrate the system:

- `options->Trans = NOTRANS`

$$
\text{diag}(R) \cdot A \cdot \text{diag}(C) \cdot \text{diag}(C)^{-1}\cdot X = \text{diag}(R) \cdot B
$$

- `options->Trans = TRANS`:

$$
(\text{diag}(R) \cdot A \cdot \text{diag}(C))^{T} \cdot \text{diag}(R)^{-1} \cdot X = \text{diag}(C) \cdot B
$$

- `options->Trans = CONJ`

$$
(\text{diag}(R) \cdot A \cdot \text{diag}(C))^{H} \cdot \text{diag}(R) \cdot X = \text{diag}(C) \cdot B
$$

:::note
 Whether the system will be equilibrated depends on the scaling of the matrix A, but if equilibration is used, A is overwritten by $\text{diag}(R)\cdot A \cdot \text{diag}(C)$ and B by $\text{diag}(R) \cdot B$ (if `options->Trans=NOTRANS`) or $\text{diag}(C) \cdot B$ (if `options->Trans = TRANS or CONJ`).
:::

2. Permute columns of A, forming `A*Pc`, where Pc is a permutation matrix that usually preserves sparsity. For more details of this step, see sp_preorder.c.

3. If `options->Fact != FACTORED`, the LU decomposition is used to factor the matrix A (after equilibration if `options->Equil = YES`) as `Pr*A*Pc = L*U`, with Pr determined by partial pivoting.

4. Compute the reciprocal pivot growth factor.

5. If some `U(i,i) = 0`, so that U is exactly singular, then the routine returns with `info = i`. Otherwise, the factored form of A is used to estimate the condition number of the matrix A. If the reciprocal of the condition number is less than machine precision, `info = A->ncol+1` is returned as a warning, but the routine still goes on to solve for X and computes error bounds as described below.
6. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form of A.
7. If `options->IterRefine != NOREFINE`, iterative refinement is applied to improve the computed solution matrix and calculate error bounds, and backward error estimates for it.
8. If equilibration was used, the matrix X is premultiplied by `diag(C)` (if `options->Trans = NOTRANS`) or `diag(R)` (if `options->Trans = TRANS or CONJ`) so that it solves the original system before equilibration.

## A is NRformat

If A is stored row-wise (`A->Stype = SLU_NR`), apply the above algorithm to the transpose of A:

1. If `options->Equil = YES`, scaling factors are computed to equilibrate the system:

- `options->Trans = NOTRANS`:
$$
\text{diag}(R) \cdot A \cdot \text{diag}(C) \cdot \text{diag}(C)^{-1} \cdot X = \text{diag}(R) \cdot B
$$
- `options->Trans = TRANS:`
$$
(\text{diag}(R) \cdot A \cdot \text{diag}(C))^{T} \cdot \text{diag}(R)^{-1} \cdot X = \text{diag}(C) \cdot B
$$
- `options->Trans = CONJ:`
$$
(\text{diag}(R) \cdot A \cdot \text{diag}(C))^{H} \cdot \text{diag}(R)^{-1} \cdot X = \text{diag}(C) \cdot B
$$

:::note
Whether the system will be equilibrated depends on the scaling of the matrix A, but if equilibration is used, $A^{T}$ is overwritten by $\text{diag}(R) \cdot A^{T} \cdot \text{diag}(C)$ and B by $\text{diag}(R)\cdot B$ (if `trans='N'`) or $\text{diag}(C) \cdot B$ (if `trans = 'T' or 'C'`).
:::

2. Permute columns of transpose(A) (rows of A), forming `transpose(A)*Pc`, where Pc is a permutation matrix that usually preserves sparsity. For more details of this step, see sp_preorder.c.
3. If `options->Fact != FACTORED`, the LU decomposition is used to factor the `transpose(A)` (after equilibration if `options->Fact = YES`) as `Pr*transpose(A)*Pc = L*U` with the permutation Pr determined by partial pivoting.
4. Compute the reciprocal pivot growth factor.
5. If some `U(i,i) = 0`, so that U is exactly singular, then the routine returns with info = i. Otherwise, the factored form of transpose(A) is used to estimate the condition number of the matrix A. If the reciprocal of the condition number is less than machine precision, `info = A->nrow+1` is returned as a warning, but the routine still goes on to solve for X and computes error bounds as described below.
6. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form of transpose(A).
7. If `options->IterRefine != NOREFINE`, iterative refinement is applied to improve the computed solution matrix and calculate error bounds, and backward error estimates for it.
8. If equilibration was used, the matrix X is premultiplied by diag(C) (if `options->Trans = NOTRANS`) or diag(R) (if `options->Trans = TRANS or CONJ`) so that it solves the original system before equilibration.

## options

```fortran
options (input) superlu_options_t*
```

The structure defines the input parameters to control
how the LU decomposition will be performed and how the
system will be solved.

## A

```fortran
A       (input/output) SuperMatrix*
```

Matrix A in `A*X=B`, of dimension (`A->nrow, A->ncol`). The number of the linear equations is `A->nrow`.

Currently, the type of can be:

- `Stype = SLU_NC` or `SLU_NR`
- `Dtype = SLU_D`
- `Mtype = SLU_GE`.

In the future, more general A may be handled.

On entry

If `options->Fact = FACTORED` and `equed` is not 'N', then A must-have been equilibrated by the scaling factors in R and/or C.

On exit

A is not modified if `options->Equil = NO`, or if `options->Equil = YES` but `equed` = 'N' on exit.

Otherwise, if `options->Equil = YES` and `equed` is not 'N', the A is scaled as follows:

If `A->Stype = SLU_NC`:

- equed = 'R', A := `diag(R)* A`
- equed = 'C', A := `A *diag(C)`
- equed = 'B', A := `diag(R)* A *diag(C)`

If `A->Stype = SLU_NR`:

- equed = 'R', `transpose(A) := diag(R)* transpose(A)`
- equed = 'C', `transpose(A) := transpose(A) *diag(C)`
- equed = 'B', `transpose(A) := diag(R)* transpose(A) *diag(C).`

## `perm_c`

```fortran
(input/output) int*
```

If `A->Stype = SLU_NC`, Column permutation vector of size `A->ncol`, which defines the permutation matrix Pc; `perm_c[i] = j` means column i of A is in position j in `A*Pc`.

On exit, `perm_c` may be overwritten by the product of the input `perm_c` and a permutation that postorders the elimination tree of `Pc'*A'*A*Pc`; `perm_c` is not changed if the elimination tree is already in postorder.

If `A->Stype = SLU_NR`, column permutation vector of size `A->nrow`, which describes permutation of columns of `transpose(A)` (rows of A) as described above.

## `perm_r`

```fortran
(input/output) int*
```

If `A->Stype = SLU_NC`, row permutation vector of size `A->nrow`, which defines the permutation matrix Pr, and is determined by partial pivoting.  `perm_r[i] = j` means row i of A is in position j in `Pr*A`.

If `A->Stype = SLU_NR`, permutation vector of size `A->ncol`, which determines permutation of rows of transpose(A) (columns of A) as described above.

If `options->Fact = SamePattern_SameRowPerm`, the pivoting routine will try to use the input `perm_r`, unless a certain threshold criterion is violated. In that case, `perm_r` is overwritten by a new permutation determined by partial pivoting or diagonal threshold pivoting. Otherwise, `perm_r` is output argument.

## etree

```fortran
(input/output) int*,  dimension (A->ncol)
```

Elimination tree of `Pc'*A'*A*Pc`.
If `options->Fact != FACTORED` and `options->Fact != DOFACT`,
etree is an **input** argument, otherwise it is an **output** argument.

:::note
etree is a vector of parent pointers for a forest whose
vertices are the integers 0 to `A->ncol-1`; `etree[root]==A->ncol`.
:::

## equed

```fortran
(input/output) char*
```

Specifies the form of equilibration that was done.

- 'N': No equilibration.
- 'R': Row equilibration, i.e., A was premultiplied by diag(R).
- 'C': Column equilibration, i.e., A was postmultiplied by diag(C).
- 'B': Both row and column equilibration, i.e., A was replaced by `diag(R)*A*diag(C)`.

If `options->Fact = FACTORED`, equed is an **input** argument, otherwise it is an output argument.

## R

```fortran
(input/output) double*, dimension (A->nrow)
```

The row scale factors for A or transpose(A).

- If equed = 'R' or 'B', A (if `A->Stype = SLU_NC`) or transpose(A) (if `A->Stype = SLU_NR`) is multiplied on the left by diag(R).
- If equed = 'N' or 'C', R is not accessed.
- For `options->Fact = FACTORED`, R is an input argument, otherwise, R is output.
- For `options->Fact = FACTORED` and equed = 'R' or 'B', each element of R must be positive.

## C

```fortran
(input/output) double*, dimension (A->ncol)
```

The column scale factors for A or transpose(A).

- If equed = 'C' or 'B', A (if `A->Stype = SLU_NC`) or transpose(A) (if `A->Stype = SLU_NR`) is multiplied on the right by diag(C).
- If equed = 'N' or 'R', C is not accessed.
- For `options->Fact = FACTORED`, C is an input argument, otherwise, C is output.
- For `options->Fact = FACTORED` and equed = 'C' or 'B', each element of C must be positive.

## L

```fortran
(output) SuperMatrix*
```

The factor L from the factorization

```fortran
Pr*A*Pc=L*U              (if A->Stype SLU_= NC) or
Pr*transpose(A)*Pc=L*U   (if A->Stype = SLU_NR).
```

Uses compressed row subscripts storage for supernodes, i.e.,
L has types:

```fortran
Stype = SLU_SC, Dtype = SLU_D, Mtype = SLU_TRLU.
```

## U

```fortran
(output) SuperMatrix*
```

The factor U from the factorization

```fortran
Pr*A*Pc=L*U              (if A->Stype = SLU_NC) or
Pr*transpose(A)*Pc=L*U   (if A->Stype = SLU_NR).
```

Uses column-wise storage scheme, i.e., U has types:

```fortran
Stype = SLU_NC, Dtype = SLU_D, Mtype = SLU_TRU.
```

## work

```fortran
(workspace/output) void*, size (lwork) (in bytes)
```

User supplied workspace, should be large enough
to hold data structures for factors L and U.
On exit, if fact is not 'F', L and U point to this array.

## Glu

```fortran
(input/output) GlobalLU_t *
```

If `options->Fact == SamePattern_SameRowPerm`, it is an input. The matrix A will be factorized assuming that a factorization of a matrix with the same sparsity pattern and similar numerical values was performed prior to this one. Therefore, this factorization will reuse both row and column scaling factors R and C, both row and column sermutation vectors `perm_r` and `perm_c`, and the L & U data structures set up from the previous factorization.

Otherwise, it is an output.
