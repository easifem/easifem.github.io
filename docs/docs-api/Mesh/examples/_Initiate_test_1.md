This example shows how to convert the mesh generated from `Gmsh`
`MSHFile_` format into the `HDF5File_` format.

```fortran
PROGRAM main
  USE easifemBase
  USE easifemClasses
  IMPLICIT NONE
  TYPE( MSHFile_ ) :: mshFile
  TYPE( HDF5File_ ) :: hdf5file
```

Initiate an instance of `MSHFile_` which is created by Gmsh

```fortran
CALL mshFile%Initiate( filename="./meshdata/small_mesh.msh",  &
 STATUS="OLD", ACTION="READ" )
```

Open the mesh file.

```fortran
CALL mshFile%Open()
```

Read the mesh information from the file.

```fortran
CALL mshFile%Read()
```

Initiate an instance of `HDF5File_`. We will save mesh data in this file.

```fortran
CALL hdf5file%Initiate( "./meshdata/small_mesh.h5", MODE="NEW" )
```

Open the `HDF5File_` file so that we can write mesh data in this file.

```fortran
CALL hdf5file%Open()
```

Exporting mesh from `MSHFile` file to `HDF5File`.

```fortran
CALL mshFile%Export( hdf5=hdf5file, group="" )
```

Cleaning up

```fortran
  CALL mshFile%Deallocate()
  CALL hdf5file%Deallocate()
END PROGRAM main
```
