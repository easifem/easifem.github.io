# Installation of EASIFEM on Linux Machine

## Setup

Before installation of easifem we should setup a simple working environment for the library. This means that we need to set some environment variables and install some packages. The procedure is given below.

If you are not comfortable with setting up environment variables and installing packages on Linux then you should use the `setup.py` script. This will do most of the things automatically. If there is any issue with this script then you can raise the issue on github, and I will try to overcome the issue.

```bash
python3 setup.py
```

The script asks you two questions:

```bash
Do you want to automatically Install external packages? 'yes' or 'no' [Y/n]:
```

If you want the script to download following pacakages, then type `yes` else type `no`.

- curl
- git
- gcc-10
- gfortran-10
- python-3
- python3-pip
- lapack
- cmake
- gmsh
- gnuplot

The next question that you need to answer is

```bash
Do you want to automatically set environment variables? 'yes' or 'no' [Y/n]:
```

> If you want the script to set the environment variable then press `yes` else `no`. This would be enough, and you can jump to install section.


However, if you like to see and set the available options by yourself then follow the following instruction.

### Install packages

Update linux by using following commands.

```bash
sudo apt update
apt list --upgradable
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install -y curl
sudo apt install -y git
sudo apt install -y gcc-10
sudo apt install -y gfortran-10
sudo apt install -y python3
sudo apt install -y python3-pip
sudo apt install -y liblapack-dev
sudo apt install -y openmpi-bin libopenmpi-dev
sudo apt install -y cmake
sudo apt install -y gmsh
sudo apt install -y gnuplot
```

> `gnuplot` and `gmsh` are relatively big programs. You can ignore their installation if you want.


### Set environment variables

**Step 1:** Go to home directory by using the following command, and check the existance of `.bashrc`

```bash
cd ~
ls ~/.bashrc
```

If `.bashrc` file does not exists then you will receive an error message something like following.

```bash
ls: cannot access '.bashrc': No such file or directory
```

We can create the `.bashrc` by following commands.

```bash
touch ~/.bashrc
```

**Step 2** Create `~/.easifemrc`

Similarly we will also create the another file `~/.easifemrc`.

```bash
touch ~/.easifemrc
```

**Step 3** Editing `~/.easifemrc`

Now we will add some important lines into `~/.easifemrc` to make our life easier while installing the library.

Open the `~/.easifemrc` in your favorite editor and add following lines.

```bash
#!/bin/sh
easifem_prefix=${HOME}
export EASIFEM_BASE=${easifem_prefix}/.easifem/base/
export EASIFEM_EXTPKGS=${easifem_prefix}/.easifem/extpkgs/
mkdir -p ${EASIFEM_EXTPKGS}
mkdir -p ${EASIFEM_BASE}
```

**Step 4** Specifying alias for latest fortran and C/C++ compilers

`easifemBase` has been tested using `gfortran-10`. It is better to compiler `easifemBase` using latest compilers. Therefore, one needs to define following alias for compiler in `.easifemrc`

```bash
export CC=/usr/bin/gcc-10
export CXX=/usr/bin/g++-10
export CPP=/usr/bin/cpp-10
export LD=/usr/bin/gcc-10
export FC=/usr/bin/gfortran-10
alias c++=/usr/bin/c++-10
alias g++=/usr/bin/g++-10
alias gcc=/usr/bin/gcc-10
alias cpp=/usr/bin/cpp-10
alias ld=/usr/bin/gcc-10
alias cc=/usr/bin/gcc-10
alias gfortran=/usr/bin/gfortran-10
```

- The 1st line specifies the path where easifem package will be installed, it is better to specify home the home directory
- The 2nd and 3rd *should not be changed*, these env-vars are needed in `CMakeLists.txt` file.
- The 4th and the 5th lines create directories, *do not change it*

**Step 5** Edit `.bashrc`

Now that we have added useful commands to our `.easifemrc`, we can bring those changes in our `.bashrc` by adding following lines in `.bashrc`

```bash
#!/bin/sh
source ~/.easifemrc
```

**Step 6** Restart the shell

Now we restart the shell to bring following changes.

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```
