# FLAP

A KISS pure Fortran Library for building powerful, easy-to-use, elegant command line interfaces

- FLAP is a pure Fortran (KISS) library for building easily nice Command Line Interfaces (CLI) for modern Fortran projects;
- FLAP is Fortran 2003+ standard compliant;
- FLAP is OOP designed;
- FLAP is a Free, Open Source Project.

> Modern Fortran standards (2003+) have introduced support for Command Line Arguments (CLA), thus it is possible to construct nice and effective Command Line Interfaces (CLI). FLAP is a small library designed to simplify the (repetitive) construction of complicated CLI in pure Fortran (standard 2003+). FLAP has been inspired by the python module _argparse_ trying to mimic it. Once you have defined the arguments that are required by means of a user-friendly method of the CLI, FLAP will parse the CLAs for you. It is worthy of note that FLAP, as _argparse_, also automatically generates help and usage messages and issues errors when users give the program invalid arguments.
