# Functional-Fortran

This modern fortran project is developed by [Milan Curcic](https://github.com/milancurcic). This library facilitates a set of commonly used tools in functional programming. [Read more](https://github.com/wavebitscientific/functional-fortran)

> While not designed as a purely functional programming language, modern Fortran goes a long way by letting the programmer use pure functions to encourage good functional discipline, express code in mathematical form, and minimize bug-prone mutable state. This library provides a set of commonly used tools in functional programming, with the purpose to help Fortran programmers be less imperative and more functional.
